Snake Game in Java
Welcome to the Snake Game in Java repository! This project implements the classic Snake Game using Java programming language. The game offers a nostalgic experience reminiscent of the early days of gaming, providing simple yet addictive gameplay.

java.awt.event.*: Contains event listener interfaces and classes for handling events generated by user interactions with GUI components.
javax.swing.*: Provides lightweight components for building graphical user interfaces, including windows, dialogs, and frames.
java.util.Random: Allows generating random numbers.
Features
Simple Controls: Use arrow keys to control the movement of the snake.
Scoring System: Gain points by eating food items that appear randomly on the game board.
Game Over Detection: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
Dynamic Difficulty: The speed of the snake increases as it grows longer, making the game more challenging over time.
